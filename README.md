# The SCAMPS Dataset

SCAMPS is a dataset of synthetics containing 2,800 videos (1.68M frames) with aligned cardiac and respiratory signals and facial action intensities. The RGB frames are provided alongside segmentation maps. 

It was introduced in our paper [**SCAMPS: Synthetics for Camera Measurement of Physiological Signals**](...).

Our dataset contains:
- 2,800 synthetic videos (1.68M frames)
- Aligned cardiac and respiratory waveforms for all frames
- Action unit labels for all frames
- Groundtruth heart rate, breathing rate, interbeat intervals and heat rate variability
