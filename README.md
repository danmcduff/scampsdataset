# The SCAMPS Dataset

SCAMPS is a dataset of synthetics containing 2,800 videos (1.68M frames) with aligned cardiac and respiratory signals and facial action intensities. The RGB frames are provided alongside segmentation maps. 

It was introduced in our paper [**SCAMPS: Synthetics for Camera Measurement of Physiological Signals**](...).
